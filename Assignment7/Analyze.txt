The sensor's inaccuracy was clearly felt as there were cases where the value could vary even if the distance was measured under exactly the same conditions. As a result of repeating the analysis several times along the txpower value, the lower the txpower, the more suitable it is for long-distance measurement, and the higher the txpower, the more accurate the short-range measurement was. However, since the long-distance measurement itself produced quite unstable results, it seemed generally difficult to use a distance measurement of 3 m or more. First of all, after trial and error, -59 txpower was the most ideal evaluation in our group.
